# Legislation of Ukraine 2.0

It is a public, non-profit, politically independent project aimed at promoting e-democracy in Ukraine.

We invite everyone to join in the development of e-democracy by discussing and amending existing laws and draft laws of Ukraine.

If you have time and inspiration - add laws and draft laws you are interested in the repository. Bring friends to this case as well!

Only in this way will we be able to make the laws clearer and the authorities more open!

There are no right or wrong thoughts here: you can express free your suggestions for improving laws, add existing laws or amendments to laws, discuss the lawmaking of Members of Parliament, or become a lawmaker yourself: propose a new law.

## Lobbying of draft laws

Lobbying in developed countries is a tool for cooperation and communication that leads to the approval of progressive decisions that are beneficial to both business and society.

We believe that the promotion of interests is possible only through focused pressure on government bodies and thus changes in society can be achieved. We uphold state interests in the international arena and public or private interests within the state.
