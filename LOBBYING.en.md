# Lobbying

Lobbying (advocacy) is a legal democratic way of interaction between government and society. Today, this institute exists in every civilized country in the world and is part of the political system.

If you are interested in a specific draft law in the form of a [pull-request](https://github.com/opensourcewebsite-org/ua-law/pulls) or political area, we can join our forces to achieve an effective influence on decision-making authorities and to represent our view of the issue. We guarantee that the process is transparent and within the law. We collaborate with the best members of the [Ukrainian Association of GR Professionals and Lobbyists](http://grukraine.com.ua), with government bodies, impact groups, and the media.

Our team uses non-standard, creative, but legitimate means to achieve the desired results, as well as classic forms of lobbying such as:

* distribution of information materials to subjects of a legislative initiative or to members of the public for familiarization and further use;

* submission of petitions and information campaigns in support of them (to the President of Ukraine, to the Cabinet of Ministers, to the Verkhovna Rada (Parliament), to local self-government bodies);

* organizing and conducting events: roundtables, seminars, conferences, etc. (including with the participation of Members of Parliament and state employees) on the need to adopt laws;

* conducting information campaigns in the mass media and social media (to explain the content of future amendments and to form a positive public opinion);

* examination of draft laws submitted to the Verkhovna Rada with detailed and specific proposals for improvement of provisions, for the inclusion of provisions or exclusion of certain provisions of the draft law;

* interventions at open parliamentary or committee hearings to convey views on issues that need the attention of Members of Parliament or legislative regulation.

We are open to proposals, business contacts and new formats of cooperation for the promotion of ideas and the application of methods of civil lobbying in Ukraine.
